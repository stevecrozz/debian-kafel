# kafel-debian

Debian packaging files for [`kafel`](https://github.com/google/kafel), a C library and language for writing syscall filter policies using seccomp-BPF.

This repository contains only the `debian/` directory and supporting files needed to build Debian packages from the upstream `kafel` source.

## ðŸ“¦ What is kafel?

Kafel is a domain-specific language and library for writing Linux seccomp-BPF rules. It simplifies the creation of secure syscall filters and is especially useful in sandboxing applications.
